                    <br/>
                        This ('Website') is provided by Bailey Barbour ('I'/'me'/'my'). In doing so, I may be in a
                        position to receive and process personal information relating to you. As the controller of this information, I am providing
                        this Privacy Notice ('Notice') to explain my approach to personal information. This Notice forms part of my Terms and
                        conditions, which governs the use of this Website.  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I intend only to process personal information fairly and transparently as required by data protection law including the
                        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Directive (EU) 2016/680 and supplemented by the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2018.
                        In particular, before obtaining information from you (including through use of cookies) I intend to alert you to this Notice,
                        let you know how I intend to process the information (including through use of cookies) and (unless processing is necessary
                        for at least one of the 5 reasons outlined in clause 2 below) I will only process the information if you consent to that
                        processing. The GDPR also defines certain 'special categories' of personal information that's considered more sensitive.
                        These categories require a higher level of protection, as explained below. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Of course, you may browse parts of this Website without providing any information about yourself and without accepting
                        cookies. In that case, it is unlikely I will possess and process any information relating to you.  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I will start this Notice by setting out the conditions I must satisfy before processing your data. However, you may wish
                        to start with this table at clause 5, which summarizes what I intend to collect, or this table at clause 9.5, which
                        summarizes my use of cookies. The Notice also explains some of the security measures I take to protect your personal
                        information, and tells you certain things I will or won't do. You should read this Notice in conjunction with the Terms
                        and conditions.  
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                        Sometimes, when you take a new service or product from me, or discuss taking a new service or product but decide against,
                        I might wish to provide you with further information about similar services or products by email or other written
                        electronic communication. In that situation, I will always give you the opportunity to refuse to receive that further
                        information and if you change your mind, please let me know. I will endeavour to remind you of your right to opt-out on
                        each occasion that I provide such information.

                        When I am allowed to collect information from you 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I will only collect personal information relating to you if one of the following conditions have been satisfied:  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        You have clearly told me that you are content for me to collect that information for the certain purpose or purposes
                        that I will have specified. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        The processing is necessary for the performance a contract that I have with you. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        The processing is necessary so that I can comply with the law. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        The processing is necessary to protect someone's life. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        The processing is necessary for performance of a task that's in the public interest. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        The processing is necessary for my or another's legitimate interest - but in this case, I will balance those interests
                        against your interests. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        How to consent 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        At the point of collecting the information, I will endeavour to explain how I intend to use the information and which of
                        these purposes apply. If I rely on consent, I will provide you with the opportunity to tell me that you are happy to
                        provide the information. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If at any point in time you change your mind and decide that you do not consent, please let me know and I will endeavour
                        to stop processing your information in the specified manner, or I will delete your data if there is no continuing reason
                        for possessing it. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If you do not consent to a particular bit of processing, I will endeavour to ensure that the Website and my service
                        continue to operate without the need for that information. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Sensitive information 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Certain information I collect may be considered to be in a special category of personal information. In particular, it
                        may relate to your health. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If I do collect such information as specified in clause 4.1, I will also ensure that one of the additional reasons for
                        processing outlined in Article 9 of the GDPR applies. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Information I expect to collect from you 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I envisage asking for the following types of information from you:  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I may collect personal information about you from a number of sources, including the following: 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        From you when you agree to take a service or product from me, in which case this may include your contact details, date
                        of birth, how you will pay for the product or service and your bank details. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        From you when you contact me with an enquiry or in response to a communication from me, in which case, this may tell me
                        something about how you use my services. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        From documents that are available to the public, such as the electoral register. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        From third parties to whom you have provided information with your consent to pass it on to other organizations or
                        persons - when I receive such information, I will let you know as soon as is reasonably practicable. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If you refuse to provide information requested, then if that information is necessary for a service, I provide to you I
                        may need to stop providing that service. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        At the time of collecting information, by whichever method is used, I will endeavour to alert you and inform you about my
                        purposes and legal basis for processing that information, as well as whether I intend to share the information with
                        anyone else or send it outside of the European Economic Area. If at any point you think I've invited you to provide
                        information without explaining why, feel free to object and ask for my reasons. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Using your personal information 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Data protection, privacy and security are important to me, and I shall only use your personal information for specified
                        purposes and shall not keep such personal information longer than is necessary to full fill these purposes. The following
                        are examples of such purposes. I have also indicated below which GDPR justification applies, however it will depend on
                        the circumstances of each case. At the time of collecting, I will provide further information, and you may always ask for
                        further information from me. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        To help me to identify you when you contact me. This will normally be necessary for the performance my contract. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        To help me to identify accounts, services and/or products which you could have from me or selected partners from time
                        to time. I may do this by automatic means using a scoring system, which uses the personal information you've provided
                        and/or any information I hold about you and personal information from third party agencies (including credit reference
                        agencies). I will only use your information for this purpose if you agree to it. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        To help me to administer and to contact you about improved administration of any accounts, services and products I have
                        provided before, do provide now or will or may provide in the future. This will often be necessary, but sometimes the
                        improvements will not be necessary in which case I will ask whether you agree. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        To allow me to carry out marketing analysis and customer profiling (including with transactional information), conduct
                        research, including creating statistical and testing information. This will sometimes require that you consent but will
                        sometimes be exempt as market research. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        To help to prevent and detect fraud or loss. This will only be done in certain circumstances when I consider it necessary,
                        or the law requires it. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        To allow me to contact you by written electronic means (such as email, text or multimedia messages) about products and
                        services offered by me where: 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        these products are similar to those you have already purchased from me, 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        you were given the opportunity to opt out of being contacted by me at the time your personal information was originally
                        collected by me and at the time of my subsequent communications with you, and 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        you have not opted out of me contacting you. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        To allow me to contact you in any way (including mail, email, telephone, visit, text or multimedia messages) about
                        products and services offered by me and selected partners where you have expressly consented to me doing so. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I may monitor and record communications with you (including phone conversations and emails) for quality assurance
                        and compliance. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Before doing that, I will always tell you of my intentions and of the specific purpose in making the recording.
                        Sometimes such recordings will be necessary to comply with the law. Alternatively, sometimes the recording will be
                        necessary for my legitimate interest, but in that case, I will only record the call if my interest outweighs yours.
                        This will depend on all the circumstances, in particular the importance of the information and whether I can obtain
                        the information another way that's less intrusive. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If I think the recording would be useful for me but that it is not necessary, I will ask whether you consent to the
                        recording, and will provide an option for you to tell me that you consent. In those situations, if you don't consent,
                        the call will either automatically end or will not be recorded. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        When it is required by law, I will check your details with fraud prevention agencies. If you provide false or inaccurate
                        information and I suspect fraud, I intend to record this. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I will not disclose your personal information to any third party except in accordance with this Notice, and in particular
                        in these circumstances: 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        They will be processing the data on my behalf as a data processor (where I will be the data controller). In that situation,
                        I will always have a contract with the data processor as set out in the GDPR. This contract provides significant
                        restrictions as to how the data processor operates so that you can be confident your data is protected to the same
                        degree as provided in this Notice. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Sometimes it might be necessary to share data with another data controller. Before doing that, I will always tell you.
                        Note that if I receive information about you from a third party, then as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards I will
                        let you know; that's required by the GDPR. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Alternatively, sometimes I might consider it to be in your interest to send your information to a third party. If that's
                        the case, I will always ask whether you agree before sending. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Where you give me personal information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have provided them with the
                        information set out in this Notice and that they have not objected to such use of their personal information. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        In connection with any transaction which I enter into with you: 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If you provide false or inaccurate information to me and I suspect fraud, I will record this and may share it with other
                        people and organizations. I, and other credit and insurance organizations, may also use technology to detect and prevent
                        fraud. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I may need to transmit the payment and delivery information provided by you during the order process for the purpose
                        of obtaining authorization from your bank or from PayPal. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I may allow other people and organizations to use personal information I hold about you in the following circumstances: 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If I, or substantially all of my assets, are acquired or are in the process of being acquired by a third party, in which
                        case personal information held by me, about my customers, will be one of the transferred assets. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If I have been legitimately asked to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings
                        or prospective legal proceedings. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I may employ companies and individuals to perform functions on my behalf and I may disclose your personal information to
                        these parties for the purposes set out above, for example, for fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal
                        mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
                        providing search results and links (including paid listings and links) and providing customer service. Those parties
                        will be bound by strict contractual provisions with me and will only have access to personal information needed to
                        perform their functions, and they may not use it for any other purpose. Further, they must process the personal
                        information in accordance with this Notice and as permitted by the GDPR. From time to time, these other people and
                        organizations to whom I may pass your personal information may be outside the European Economic Area. I will take all
                        steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this
                        Notice and the GDPR. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Protecting information 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I have strict security measures to protect personal information. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to
                        encrypt information you input. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, I transmit the
                        entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        I maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure
                        of personally identifiable customer information. My security procedures mean that I may occasionally request proof
                        of identity before I disclose personal information to you. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign
                        off when you finish using a shared computer.

                        The internet 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If you communicate with me using the internet, I may occasionally email you about my services and products. When you
                        first give me personal information through the Website, I will normally give you the opportunity to say whether you
                        would prefer that I don't contact you by email. You can also always send me an email (at the address set out below)
                        at any time if you change your mind. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Please remember that communications over the internet, such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a website),
                        are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before they
                        are delivered - this is the nature of the internet. I cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorized access or loss
                        of personal information that is beyond my control. 
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                        When I provide services, I want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts
                        of information on your computer, which is sent back to me at a later time. These are called 'cookies'. These cookies
                        are listed in the table at clause 9.5. Some websites don't use cookies but use related technology for gaining information
                        about website users such as JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other
                        technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalise advertising content. Multiple cookies may be
                        found in a single file depending on which browser you use. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Where applicable, this section of the Notice also relates to that technology, but the term 'cookie' is used throughout. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Some of these cookies are essential to services you've requested from me, whereas others are used to improve services
                        for
                        you, for example through:

                        Enabling a service to recognize your computer so you don't have to give the same information during one task

                    <br/>
                        Recognizing that you have already given a username and password, so you don't need to enter it for every web page

                        The distinctions referred to in the above table are as follows:

                    <br/>
                        First party versus third party cookies - I set first party cookies myself; third party cookies are set by other entities
                        via my Website. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Session versus persistent cookies - session cookies only persist for the duration of that visit; persistent cookies last
                        for longer

                    <br/>
                        Categories 1-4 found in the ICC UK Cookie guide, as explained below. Category 1 cookies do not require the user's consent,
                        though one must still tell them about the cookies. Categories 2-4 do require their specific and informed consent.

                        As with any other information I may collect from you, I will work to protect the security of your information during

                        Please note that I may have to amend this Notice on occasion, for example if I change the cookies that I use. If I do that,
                        I will publish the amended version on the Website. In that situation I will endeavour to alert you to the change, but it is
                        also your responsibility to check regularly to determine whether this Notice has changed.
